## Notes on Lamina

### Notes from Tellman StrangeLoop presentations
* http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Event-Driven-Programming-in-Clojure
* Tellman proposes handling async programming with an "event-driven data structure"
* In a fork-join scenario, the join assumes the task will complete. This differs from Pike's go-concurrency examples
* Threads are not free and we address that by creating Thread pools
 * If I'm going to create my own daemon-future threads, to be robust it would need to use a Thread pool (or would it?)


### Questions for Zach / Lamina Google group

I'm new to lamina.  I've been reading about it and listened to Zach's StrangeLoop presentation and have a couple questions.

First I realize that the primary use case for channels is an event queue, which likely means you want it to be unbounded and non-blocking. Thus, lamina uses a ConcurrentLinkedQueue underneath.

But I've been playing with lamina as a tool to implement the concurrency constructs in Go (the language).

* Is there a way to constrain the size of a channel, such that an attempt to enqueue a "full" channel will block?  I don't want to close the channel, I just want to constrain it's size - it can have values (events) moving through it, but cannot ever be large than size N.  This could be via the LinkedBlockingQueue, for example.  If no, is there another way to apply "backpressure" on the data/events coming into the channel?

* Is there a way to use a ResultChannel as a queue of 1?  Or once it's realized it is "stuck" and cannot be used for anything besides reading that value (akin to a promise).
==> NO, don't ask

* There is a relatively undocumented `named-channel` fn - what is the value of a named channel?  What use case would it be good for? 

* How is the broadcast-channel not an infinite loop?
  * I get: StackOverflowError   java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock.unlock (ReentrantLock.java:460)

* This piece of documentation is misleading:
  * A single channel can be useful on its own, when used as an asynchronous variant of a LinkedBlockingQueue, but most of the time we donâ€™t want to handle each message individually.
  * From: https://github.com/ztellman/lamina/wiki/Channels-new


* How does join work?  See diagram in the Tellman blog entry
  * See k1-main3 of kaychayev's "boring" examples
  * (join ch1 ch2)  => ch2 will be the destination for messages to ch1
  * All messages enq'd into ch1 will immediately be drained to ch2 =>
  * it is basically the right way to do: (def ch2 (map* identity ch1))


## Another thing to look into
* http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorCompletionService.html
 * recommended here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11298961/equivalent-of-goroutines-in-clojure-java
 * will this be useful to this endeavor?
  * Reviewed: The ExecutorCompletionServer is will help you get the next available result from a pool of Futures, but it cannot be a general purpose Go channel, bcs it can only return one result per future - it is constrained by the mechanics of how a future works

## Notes for blog entries

In the first blog entry, I introduced some simple examples of the CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) model of concurrency that have been built into the Go language. In this blog series, I'm cataloging my investigation of how we might leverage this style of concurrent programming in Clojure.

The key benefit of the CSP approach is that you can use sequential semantics of non-current programs to simplify dealing with concurrency.  Channels are used to communicate and synchronize processes to bring some control or determinism to an otherwise non-deterministic concurrent environment.  We can do this without locks or other low-level constructs that are hard to reason about.  The CSP is built on top of those low-level primitives (or at least compare-and-swap mechanisms), but they are hidden from view from the application developer.
